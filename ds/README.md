# Introduction to Data Structures

## What is Data?

Data is the collection of different numbers, symbols, and alphabets to represent information.

## What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a group of data elements that provides the easiest way to store and perform different actions on the data of the computer. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.

The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure.

A data structure has also defined an instance of ADT.ADT means ABSTRACT DATA TYPE. It is formally defined as a triplet.[ D,F,A]

> **D: Set of the domain.F: the set of operations.A: the set of axioms.**

## Type of data structure

- Linear Data Structure
- Non-Linear Data Structure.

## Linear Data Structure

- Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
- Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

## Non-Linear Data Structure

- Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
- Example: tree, graph, table, etc.

## Data structures are used in various fields such as:

- Operating system
- Graphics
- Computer Design
- Blockchain
- Genetics
- Image Processing
- Simulation etc.
